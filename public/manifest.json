  "description": "Hello end user, if you are reading this, please do not expect damm! from this app. I don't know much about image processing and it's very hard to apply those bookish theories using javascript only. I learned about image processing in my last semester and the basic idea was that to apply this knowledge into something. I created few preset filters and custom editing options for user and rotate and flip image feature, cropping will be added as future update. Stay happy, Enjoy... ðŸ˜„",
