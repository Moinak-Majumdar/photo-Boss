Photo Boss is a mobile optimize photo editor PWA (progressive web app). But the beauty of this editor is the responsive design because of that it is suitable for small to extra large device.

<b>Motivation :</b> I learned about image processing in 6th sem of my B.Sc course and the basic idea was that to apply this knowledge into something. I created few preset filters and custom editing options for user and rotate and flip image feature.

<b>Working Method :</b> Photo Boss applies user input / preset on a image by css filters / transformation property. It allows us to add various filters like brightness, hue rotate, saturation, blur etc. Photo Boss also offers 10 various preset filters for modern lifestyle images. Finally it replicate the input image by html canvas property and saves in user device.

<b>Future Update :</b> Cropping will be added as future update. Stay happy, Enjoy... ðŸ˜„
